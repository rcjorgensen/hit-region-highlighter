# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing, you can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor or online tool.

Suggested icon design:
- A target/crosshair symbol to represent "hit regions"
- Use green color (#00ff00) to match the default highlight color
- Simple, clear design that works at small sizes

## Creating Icons Quickly

You can use online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Or any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)

Alternatively, you can use a simple colored square as a placeholder during development.
